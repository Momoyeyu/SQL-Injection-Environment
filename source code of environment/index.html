<!--
    This is a fake index that jump to the real index automatically.
    I wrote this page because I had trouble opening the true index (html.index.html) directly.
    The server seem unable to open a page that is not in the root dir of the website.
    I hope someone can help me out.
    If you know how to open the true index (html/index.html),left your comment or email me directly (momoyeyu@outlook.com).
